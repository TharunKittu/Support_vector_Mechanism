# Support_vector_Mechanism
# PROJECT TITLE : 
Using Support Vector Algorithm of Supervised MachineLearning.Predict "iris.csv" Dataset to findout whether Speices will be Same or Different
# Task :
1) Preprocess the Data in Skit.learn Library
2) Load the Data using sklearn Modelselection Default Arguement.
3) On the basis of your dataset Train,Test and Split our SVM Model.
4) Implement Support vector Mechanism classifier using svm_classfier.The svm must be "Linear"
5) Train the Classifer on Training Data
6) Findout Prediction value on TestData
7) Test the Model with help of Accuracy,Accuracy should lie in range(0-1)
